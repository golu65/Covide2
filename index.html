            <p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate  reillness an
                without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical
                attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,
                diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can
                get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>
